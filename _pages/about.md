Hey, I'm Bohan Yao. I'm currently an undergraduate at the University of Washington majoring in computer science and statistics. I also interned at ServiceNow during 2024 and 2025, where I worked on LLM post-training and agentic systems. I work on natural language processing (NLP) research, and my primary research is in developing systems that can tackle challenging reasoning tasks across various domains such as math, coding, etc. Specifically, I have recently worked on tool-augmented LLM frameworks and systems for automated agentic system design.
